       My name is Daniel Alonso Williams. I come from a small town named Merced, in the great state of California.I am interested in a lot of things like coding, Dance Gavin Dance's music, working out, improving myself, solving problems to any given situation,spending time with family,hanging out with Jess,but the most interesting thing I find is robotics, more specifically in the field of artificial intelligence (A.I.). HTML and CSS are ok. Gotta know the basics though I suppose. I'm interested in Software development primarily because I have a dream of one day building my own custom 1950's themed home. Retro, modern, connected with a personally customizable robotic butler. Each family will be able to give their own Robotic servant a name. If no name is chosen Cervantes, will be the default name.There will be multiple robots and they will be so advanced that they can be financed.
